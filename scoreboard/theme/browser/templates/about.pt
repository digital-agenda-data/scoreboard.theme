      <p>Visualisation tool for open datasets, indicators about EU Digital Single Market policies, digital progress of European Economy and Society, DESI index and country factsheets.</p>
      <p>This visualisation tool allows you to explore some open datasets through the interactive creation of charts and tables. The indicators have been selected to support the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digital-single-market">EU Digital Single Market policies</a> and to monitor the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-digital-progress-report">digital progress of European Economy and Society</a>, through annual reports, a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/desi">DESI</a> index and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/progress-country">country factsheets</a>.</p>
      <p>The charts can be exported as images, printed, embedded or shared through hyperlinks. You can download the data behind a chart or the entire dataset, including the metadata providing labels, definitions, methodological notes, references and sources. Use the "download" and "export" buttons present on each chart, or refer to the page "Entire dataset metadata and download services".</p>
      <p>Each dataset is stored in a semantic data repository to facilitate their reuse and the linking to other data published on the web. For browsing or querying of the semantic repository please follow the <a tal:attributes="href view/defaultCRUrl">link</a>. You will find functionalities for human and machine reading of data and metadata. The <a href="./documentation">documentation page</a> presents some reports and notes about the technical characteristics of the project developing the present visualisation tool and semantic repository.</p>
